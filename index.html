I am Sivaguru T. I am working as a Techincal lead.

In java and UI Frameworks, I have around 11 Yrs of experience which has only increased my hunger for learn. 
In this blog, I will be writing on different topics occasionally, and would like to engage meaningful discussions with you folks.

My other hobbies love watching movies.
